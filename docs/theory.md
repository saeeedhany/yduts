## Why I Built This

I’ve always had one specific problem:
I can’t multitask.
Not in the “haha funny I get distracted” way — I mean literally, my brain refuses to split itself.
When I try to juggle more than one thing, everything collapses.
But when I choose one task and lock in, I can finish anything.

That’s where yduts comes from.

It’s not a productivity tool in the traditional sense.
It’s more like a small personal philosophy turned into a CLI program.
Instead of managing to-do lists, timers, goals, or routines…
it creates a space for one thing only.
One session.
One intention.
One direction.

yduts is basically me saying:
“This is how I survive the chaos.
This is how I finish things.
Maybe it will help someone who works the same way.”

If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t thrive on multitasking, who just wants to commit deeply to a single task without feeling guilty about everything else — you might find something honest here.
Not a system.
Not a hack.
Just a quieter way to work.
